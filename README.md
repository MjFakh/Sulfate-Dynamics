# Sulfate-Dynamics

Dynamical analysis of seawater sulfate mass balance. The code is written in Matlab and it would calculate the range of steady state concentrations for seawater sulfate. The main code is named as "SO4_dynamical_analysis.m". The file "fanChart.m" needs to be added to the same folder as the main code to be able to plot the results as a fan chart.
